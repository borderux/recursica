You need to review the changes in the files in the current branch against the main branch.  Analyze the files and check for
1. Proper code documentation.  All new functions should be properly documented
2. Any errors in coding style or complexity that could be improved
3. Check that proper testing has been performed.  Ideally unit tests were created to test functionality, or prompt the user how validation was performed to ensure code is working
When that is done, you should review the code base and ensure that any documentation that references these files has been updated. Pay special attention to project documentation (md files) to make sure that functionality these files change that may have impacted the project documentation has been updated.  

Finally, create a pull request using the automated script. Based on your analysis of the changes, generate an appropriate title and description for the pull request. Run:

npm run pr -- --title="Your Generated Title" --description="Your generated description"

This will create a pull request with the title and description you provide based on your analysis of the actual changes made.

After creating the PR, commit this work with a message that indicates the AI agent performed the PR check:

npm run pr:commit -- --title="Your Generated Title"
