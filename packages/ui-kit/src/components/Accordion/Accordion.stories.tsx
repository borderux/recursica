          <Accordion.Panel>
            Recursica is a design system platform that helps teams create,
            manage, and distribute design tokens and components across their
            projects.

          <Accordion.Control>How does it work?</Accordion.Control>
          <Accordion.Panel>
            Recursica connects your design tools (like Figma) with your
            development workflow, automatically syncing design tokens and
            generating code-ready components.

          <Accordion.Panel>
            Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€”
            specifically, they are named entities that store visual design
            attributes.

            Components are reusable UI elements that can be combined to create
            more complex interfaces. They follow consistent design patterns and
