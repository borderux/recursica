# Figma Plugin UI Enhancement - Version Display Feature

## Overview

This pull request enhances the Figma plugin user interface by adding plugin version display functionality. The version information is displayed as a subtle caption in the bottom-right corner of the layout, providing users with transparency about which version of the plugin they are currently using. This improvement enhances user experience and aids in debugging and support scenarios.

## Changes Made

### Core Functionality:

- **Added plugin version tracking**: Extended the Figma context to include `pluginVersion` state management
- **Enhanced Layout component**: Added version display in the bottom-right corner using Typography component
- **Updated context interface**: Added `pluginVersion` property to `IFigmaContext` interface
- **Message handling**: Extended the message handler to process plugin version from metadata

### Files Modified:

1. **`apps/figma-plugin/src/components/Layout/Layout.tsx`**:

   - Added imports for `Box` and `Typography` components from UI kit
   - Added `useFigma` hook import to access plugin version
   - Integrated plugin version display with proper styling and positioning
   - Used absolute positioning to place version info in bottom-right corner
   - Applied consistent styling with opacity and caption typography variant

2. **`apps/figma-plugin/src/context/Figma/FigmaContext.ts`**:

   - Added `pluginVersion: string | undefined` to the `IFigmaContext` interface
   - Maintains type safety for the new version property

3. **`apps/figma-plugin/src/context/Figma/FigmaProvider.tsx`**:
   - Added `pluginVersion` state management with `useState`
   - Extended message handler to extract version from `METADATA` payload
   - Updated context value object to include the new `pluginVersion` property
   - Integrated with existing metadata collection flow

### Technical Implementation:

- **State Management**: Plugin version is managed through React context and state
- **Message Processing**: Version is extracted from the `METADATA` message type sent by the plugin code
- **UI Integration**: Version display uses existing design system components from `@recursica/ui-kit-mantine`
- **Styling**: Consistent with existing UI patterns using opacity (0.84) and caption typography
- **Positioning**: Absolute positioning ensures version display doesn't interfere with main content

## Code Quality Assessment

### Documentation:

- ✅ All new functions and components are properly documented
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces are clearly defined with proper typing
- ✅ Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- ✅ Component props are well-typed with `PropsWithChildren`

### Coding Style:

- ✅ Consistent with existing codebase patterns
- ✅ Proper TypeScript typing throughout
- ✅ Clean component structure and separation of concerns
- ✅ No linting errors or TypeScript compilation issues
- ✅ Follows React best practices with proper hook usage
- ✅ Uses existing design system components appropriately

### Testing:

- ⚠️ No unit tests were created for the new functionality
- ✅ Manual testing should be performed to verify:
  - Version display appears correctly in UI
  - Version updates when plugin is updated
  - Message handling works with different metadata payloads
  - Layout positioning works across different screen sizes
  - Version display doesn't interfere with existing UI elements

## Impact

This enhancement improves the user experience by:

- **Transparency**: Users can see which version of the plugin they're using
- **Debugging**: Helps with troubleshooting by identifying plugin versions
- **User Confidence**: Provides clear indication of plugin status and updates
- **Maintainability**: Establishes pattern for future version-related features
- **Support**: Aids in customer support by easily identifying plugin versions

## Testing Recommendations

To validate this functionality, test the following scenarios:

1. **Version Display**: Verify the plugin version appears in the bottom-right corner
2. **Message Handling**: Test with various metadata payloads
3. **Responsive Design**: Check version display on different screen sizes
4. **Update Scenarios**: Verify version updates when plugin is upgraded
5. **Error Handling**: Test behavior when version information is missing
6. **UI Integration**: Ensure version display doesn't overlap with other UI elements
7. **Context Integration**: Verify version is properly passed through React context

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation should be reviewed and potentially updated:

- **README.md**: May need updates to reflect version display feature
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Should be updated with this new feature
- **PLUGIN.MD**: May need updates if version display affects plugin usage

## Checklist

- [x] Plugin version state management implemented
- [x] Context interface updated with proper typing
- [x] Layout component enhanced with version display
- [x] Message handling extended for version extraction
- [x] No linting errors introduced
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- [x] Uses existing design system components
- [ ] Unit tests should be added for new functionality
- [ ] Manual testing required for UI validation
- [ ] Documentation updates may be needed

## Additional Notes

This is a user-facing enhancement that adds transparency to the plugin experience. The implementation is minimal and follows existing patterns, making it easy to maintain and extend. The version display is subtle and non-intrusive, positioned to provide information without interfering with the main user interface.

**Recommendations for future iterations:**

- Add unit tests for the message handling logic and version display component
- Consider adding version comparison functionality for update notifications
- Evaluate adding version information to error messages for better debugging
