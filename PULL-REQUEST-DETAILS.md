# Figma Plugin Release Enhancement

## Overview

This pull request adds plugin version display functionality to the Figma plugin, enhancing the user experience by showing the current plugin version in the UI. The version information is displayed as a subtle caption in the bottom-right corner of the layout, providing users with transparency about which version of the plugin they are currently using.

## Changes Made

### Core Functionality:

- **Added plugin version tracking**: Extended the Figma context to include `pluginVersion` state management
- **Enhanced Layout component**: Added version display in the bottom-right corner using Typography component
- **Updated context interface**: Added `pluginVersion` property to `IFigmaContext` interface
- **Message handling**: Extended the message handler to process plugin version from metadata

### Files Modified:

1. **`apps/figma-plugin/src/components/Layout/Layout.tsx`**:

   - Added imports for `Box` and `Typography` components from UI kit
   - Added `useFigma` hook import
   - Integrated plugin version display with proper styling and positioning
   - Used absolute positioning to place version info in bottom-right corner

2. **`apps/figma-plugin/src/context/Figma/FigmaContext.ts`**:

   - Added `pluginVersion: string | undefined` to the `IFigmaContext` interface
   - Maintains type safety for the new version property

3. **`apps/figma-plugin/src/context/Figma/FigmaProvider.tsx`**:
   - Added `pluginVersion` state management with `useState`
   - Extended message handler to extract version from `METADATA` payload
   - Updated context value object to include the new `pluginVersion` property

### Technical Implementation:

- **State Management**: Plugin version is managed through React context and state
- **Message Processing**: Version is extracted from the `METADATA` message type
- **UI Integration**: Version display uses existing design system components
- **Styling**: Consistent with existing UI patterns using opacity and caption typography

## Code Quality Assessment

### Documentation:

- ✅ All new functions and components are properly documented
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces are clearly defined
- ✅ Code follows existing patterns and conventions

### Coding Style:

- ✅ Consistent with existing codebase patterns
- ✅ Proper TypeScript typing throughout
- ✅ Clean component structure and separation of concerns
- ✅ No linting errors or TypeScript compilation issues

### Testing:

- ⚠️ No unit tests were created for the new functionality
- ✅ Manual testing should be performed to verify:
  - Version display appears correctly in UI
  - Version updates when plugin is updated
  - Message handling works with different metadata payloads
  - Layout positioning works across different screen sizes

## Impact

This enhancement improves the user experience by:

- **Transparency**: Users can see which version of the plugin they're using
- **Debugging**: Helps with troubleshooting by identifying plugin versions
- **User Confidence**: Provides clear indication of plugin status and updates
- **Maintainability**: Establishes pattern for future version-related features

## Testing Recommendations

To validate this functionality, test the following scenarios:

1. **Version Display**: Verify the plugin version appears in the bottom-right corner
2. **Message Handling**: Test with various metadata payloads
3. **Responsive Design**: Check version display on different screen sizes
4. **Update Scenarios**: Verify version updates when plugin is upgraded
5. **Error Handling**: Test behavior when version information is missing

## Checklist

- [x] Plugin version state management implemented
- [x] Context interface updated with proper typing
- [x] Layout component enhanced with version display
- [x] Message handling extended for version extraction
- [x] No linting errors introduced
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and conventions
