# Pull Request Details

## Description

This pull request updates the homepage URL in the UI Kit Mantine package configuration to point directly to the package's README file in the repository. This change improves the user experience by directing users to the specific package documentation rather than the general repository README.

## Changes Made

### Package Configuration Update:

- **Updated `packages/ui-kit-mantine/package.json`**: Modified homepage URL
  - Changed from: `https://github.com/borderux/recursica#readme`
  - Changed to: `https://github.com/borderux/recursica/tree/main/packages/ui-kit-mantine`
  - This directs users to the specific package directory containing the README.md file

## Technical Implementation

### URL Structure:

The updated homepage URL follows GitHub's standard URL structure for repository directories:

- **Format**: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/tree/{branch}/{path}`
- **Purpose**: Provides direct access to the package's documentation and source code
- **User Experience**: Users can immediately see the package structure and access the README file

## Testing & Validation

- **URL Validation**: Verified the new URL correctly points to the ui-kit-mantine package directory
- **Documentation**: Confirmed the README.md file is accessible at the new location
- **Configuration**: Validated package.json syntax remains correct

## Impact

This change improves the developer experience by:

- **Direct Navigation**: Users can immediately access package-specific documentation
- **Clear Context**: The URL clearly indicates which package the documentation belongs to
- **Repository Structure**: Better reflects the monorepo structure of the project
