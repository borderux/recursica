# Pull Request Details

## Description

This pull request implements a comprehensive architectural refactoring of the Figma plugin's repository management system based on user feedback. The changes introduce a modular hook-based architecture that improves code organization, maintainability, and separation of concerns while enhancing error handling and user experience.

## Changes Made

### Figma Plugin Architecture Refactoring:

**Major Structural Changes:**

- **Modular Hook Architecture**: Refactored the monolithic `RepositoryProvider` component into specialized, reusable custom hooks
- **Separation of Concerns**: Extracted complex logic into focused, single-responsibility hooks for better maintainability
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implemented centralized error management with better user feedback and recovery mechanisms
- **Improved Performance**: Optimized file loading and remote data fetching with parallel processing

**New Custom Hooks Created:**

1. **`useFileData`** - Manages local and remote file data state with backward compatibility
2. **`useRepositoryInstance`** - Handles repository instance creation based on platform (GitHub/GitLab)
3. **`useAdapterWorker`** - Manages Web Worker execution for adapter processing with enhanced error handling and timeout management
4. **`useRepositoryError`** - Centralized error handling with detailed error categorization and user-friendly messages
5. **`useFileStatus`** - Tracks file processing status across different stages (icons, tokens, themes, UI kit, adapter)
6. **`useProjectValidation`** - Handles project configuration validation and status management
7. **`useRepositoryOperations`** - Manages repository operations (user info, projects, branches, commits, pull requests)
8. **`useRemoteFiles`** - Handles fetching and caching of remote files from repositories

**Refactored Components:**

- **`RepositoryProvider`**: Significantly simplified by extracting logic into custom hooks, reduced from ~500 lines to ~160 lines
- **`RepositoryContext`**: Updated imports to use new hook-based architecture
- **`Home` Component**: Added missing dependency (`target`) to useEffect dependency array for better synchronization
- **`PublishChanges` Component**: Improved user-facing text for better clarity and platform-specific messaging

**Enhanced Features:**

- **Worker Response Handling**: Simplified adapter worker response processing with better type safety
- **Parallel Processing**: Implemented parallel fetching of team library collections for improved performance
- **Remote File Management**: Added sophisticated remote file fetching with fallback mechanisms
- **Error Recovery**: Enhanced error handling with expected error categorization and user-friendly messaging
- **File Status Tracking**: Improved real-time status updates for better user feedback

**Configuration Updates:**

- **Manifest Updates**: Updated Figma plugin manifest IDs for both development and production environments
- **Team Library Logic**: Fixed condition in `teamLibrary.ts` from `=== 1` to `> 0` for better collection handling

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality Enhancements:

- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Proper typing for all new hooks and data structures
- **Error Boundaries**: Better error isolation and recovery mechanisms
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of Web Workers and event listeners
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced unnecessary re-renders and improved data flow

### Architecture Benefits:

- **Modularity**: Each hook has a single responsibility, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain
- **Testability**: Smaller, focused functions are easier to unit test
- **Reusability**: Hooks can be reused across different components
- **Debugging**: Better error isolation makes debugging more straightforward

## Testing

**Current Testing Status:**

- ✅ Code follows project style guidelines (ESLint passes with no errors)
- ✅ Self-review completed
- ✅ No breaking changes introduced
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained through legacy property support
- ⚠️ **Unit tests needed**: New custom hooks lack unit test coverage

**Manual Testing Performed:**

- Verified repository connection functionality across GitHub and GitLab platforms
- Confirmed file status tracking works correctly through all phases
- Tested error handling with various failure scenarios
- Validated Web Worker processing with timeout and error recovery
- Confirmed UI text improvements enhance user experience

## Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes maintain backward compatibility through:

- Legacy property support in `useFileData` hook
- Preserved existing component interfaces
- Maintained existing context structure

## Recommendations for Follow-up

1. **Add Unit Tests**: Create comprehensive test coverage for the new custom hooks
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement metrics to track the performance improvements
3. **Documentation Updates**: Consider updating README to reflect the new architecture
4. **Integration Testing**: Add end-to-end tests for the complete workflow
