# Pull Request Details

## Description

This pull request updates the GitHub Action workflow that automatically populates pull request descriptions. The workflow has been modified to only populate PR descriptions when they are empty, preserving manually written descriptions and preventing overwrites of existing content.

## Changes Made

### GitHub Actions Workflow:

- **Updated `.github/workflows/pr-description.yml`**: Modified the auto-population logic to respect existing PR descriptions
  - Added clear documentation explaining the workflow behavior
  - Changed logic to only populate descriptions when they are empty or contain only whitespace
  - Updated step names and logging messages for better clarity
  - Preserves manually written PR descriptions from being overwritten

### Key Improvements:

1. **Empty Description Check**: The workflow now checks if the PR description is empty (`!currentBody || currentBody.trim() === ''`) before populating it
2. **Documentation**: Added header comments explaining the workflow's purpose and behavior
3. **Better Logging**: Updated console messages to clearly indicate when descriptions are populated vs. skipped
4. **Preservation of Manual Content**: Existing PR descriptions are left untouched, regardless of whether they match the `PULL-REQUEST-DETAILS.md` content

## Technical Implementation

### Workflow Behavior:

1. **Trigger**: Runs when PRs are opened or reopened
2. **File Check**: Verifies `PULL-REQUEST-DETAILS.md` exists in the repository
3. **Content Analysis**: Reads the current PR description and the details file content
4. **Conditional Update**: Only updates the PR description if it's currently empty
5. **Logging**: Provides clear feedback about whether the description was updated or skipped

### Code Changes:

- **Logic Update**: Changed from `currentBody !== content` to `!currentBody || currentBody.trim() === ''`
- **Documentation**: Added workflow description comments
- **Step Naming**: Updated step name to "Populate PR description (only if empty)"
- **Logging**: Improved console messages for better debugging and transparency

## Benefits

- **Respects Manual Work**: Developers can write their own PR descriptions without fear of them being overwritten
- **Reduces Noise**: Prevents unnecessary API calls when descriptions already exist
- **Clear Intent**: The workflow's behavior is now well-documented and predictable
- **Better UX**: Developers have full control over their PR descriptions while still benefiting from auto-population when needed

## Testing & Validation

- **Logic Testing**: Verified the empty check logic works correctly for various scenarios:
  - Empty description (`null` or `undefined`)
  - Whitespace-only description
  - Existing content (should be preserved)
- **Documentation**: Confirmed workflow comments clearly explain the behavior
- **No Breaking Changes**: The workflow still functions as expected for empty PR descriptions

## Checklist

- [x] GitHub Actions workflow updated with empty description check
- [x] Documentation added to explain workflow behavior
- [x] Step names and logging messages updated for clarity
- [x] Logic tested for various PR description states
- [x] No breaking changes introduced
- [x] Workflow preserves existing PR descriptions

## Additional Notes

This change improves the developer experience by making the auto-population feature more respectful of manual work while maintaining the convenience of automatic PR description population for new PRs. The workflow now strikes a better balance between automation and developer control.
