# Pull Request Details

## Description

This pull request fixes Vitest configuration errors in the Figma plugin and enhances the pre-push git hook to provide better error feedback and user guidance.

## Changes Made

### Figma Plugin - Vitest Fixes:

- **Removed incorrectly configured files**:
  - Deleted `apps/figma-plugin/vitest.workspace.ts` - Was configured as regular config instead of workspace
  - Deleted `apps/figma-plugin/vitest.shims.d.ts` - Not needed without tests
- **Removed unused dependencies** from `package.json`:
  - `@vitest/browser` - Only needed for browser testing
  - `@vitest/coverage-v8` - Only needed for test coverage
  - `vitest` - Main Vitest package
  - `playwright` - Only used for Vitest browser testing

### Pre-Push Hook Improvements:

- **Enhanced error messages**: More descriptive output with clear action items
- **Better error handling**: Added validation for missing remote branches
- **Step-by-step instructions**: Clear guidance for using Cursor to update PR details
- **Clean output formatting**: Removed special characters that don't display well in git
- **Contextual information**: Shows branch names and file paths for better debugging

## Root Cause

The Vitest errors were caused by:

- `vitest.workspace.ts` being incorrectly configured as a regular Vitest config file instead of a workspace configuration
- Unnecessary testing dependencies in a project that doesn't have tests
- Missing remote branch validation in the pre-push hook

## Testing

- Verified that Vitest no longer throws configuration errors
- Confirmed that the figma-plugin project doesn't have any test files
- Tested the pre-push hook with various scenarios (missing remote, unupdated PR details)
- Validated that error messages are clear and actionable

## Checklist

- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Self-review completed
- [x] Vitest errors resolved
- [x] Unused dependencies removed
- [x] Pre-push hook improvements implemented
- [x] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [x] No breaking changes introduced

## Additional Notes

The figma-plugin project doesn't require testing setup since it doesn't contain any test files. Removing the unnecessary Vitest configuration and dependencies resolves the startup errors while keeping the project clean. The enhanced pre-push hook provides better developer experience with clearer error messages and specific instructions for resolving issues.
