# Introduction to Recursica

## What is Recursica?

Recursica is a comprehensive design system and implementation platform that bridges the gap between designers and developers. It provides a unified platform for creating consistent, beautiful user interfaces by seamlessly connecting Figma design workflows with modern frontend development practices.

## Purpose & Philosophy

Recursica was built on the fundamental belief that design and development should work in perfect harmony. Too often, design systems fail because they create friction between designers and developers, leading to inconsistent implementations and frustrated teams.

### Core Principles

- **Designer-Developer Bridge**: Design system and implementation meant to bridge designers and developers, enabling seamless collaboration
- **Common Language**: Keep consistent terminology between development and design. Components, props, and variables use the same naming conventions so both teams speak the same language
- **Designer Autonomy**: Designers can push changes directly to the repository and verify them using Storybook without requiring developer involvement
- **Token Synchronization**: Plugin that syncs design tokens from Figma so they can be easily used in code with automatic TypeScript type generation
- **Leverage Existing Solutions**: Utilize existing popular UI kits without reinventing code through the use of adapters, inheriting base UI kit behaviors and only overriding when necessary
- **Automatic Change Detection**: Automatic detection of changes and design issues using the power of TypeScript to maintain consistency
- **Single Source of Truth**: Design tokens and components live in one place, ensuring consistency across all touchpoints
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support ensures design decisions are enforced at compile time

### The Recursica Approach

#### 1. Design-First Thinking

We start with design because great user experiences begin with thoughtful design decisions. Recursica ensures that every design decision made in Figma can be faithfully implemented in code.

#### 2. Developer Experience

While design is our starting point, we never compromise on developer experience. Our components are built with modern React patterns, full TypeScript support, and comprehensive documentation.

#### 3. Scalability & Maintainability

Recursica grows with your team and product. Whether you're building a small application or a large-scale platform, our modular architecture scales to meet your needs.

#### 4. Performance by Design

Every component is optimized for performance, using modern CSS techniques like Vanilla Extract for zero-runtime styling and efficient bundle sizes.

## Core Components

### 1. Figma Plugin

The heart of Recursica's design-to-code workflow. Our Figma plugin syncs design tokens from Figma so they can be easily used in code, enabling designers to push changes directly to the repository.

**Key Features:**

- **Token Synchronization**: Export design tokens as JSON with automatic TypeScript type generation
- **Component Generation**: Generate component code from Figma components with consistent naming
- **Automatic Change Detection**: Leverage TypeScript's power to detect design issues and changes automatically
- **Designer Verification**: Enable designers to verify changes using Storybook without developer involvement
- **Repository Integration**: Direct synchronization with your codebase and git workflow
- **Multi-Project Support**: Support for multiple project types (UI kits, themes, icons)

### 2. UI Kit Library

A comprehensive React component library built with Mantine and TypeScript, utilizing adapters to leverage existing popular UI kits without reinventing code. The library inherits base UI kit behaviors and only overrides when necessary.

**Key Features:**

- **60+ Components**: From basic buttons to complex data tables
- **Adapter Architecture**: Leverage existing popular UI kits (Mantine) without reinventing code
- **Design Token Integration**: Direct access to your Figma design tokens with consistent naming
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety and IntelliSense with automatic type generation
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant components out of the box
- **Theming**: Flexible theming system that respects your design decisions
- **Common Language**: Same naming conventions for components and props between design and development

### 3. Configuration System

The `recursica.json` configuration file allows teams to customize how Recursica works with their specific project needs:

- Project-specific settings
- Design token overrides
- Component customization
- Build and deployment configuration

### 4. Development Tools

A suite of tools that make working with Recursica a pleasure:

- **Storybook Integration**: Interactive component documentation
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line utilities for common tasks
- **Build System**: Optimized bundling and tree-shaking
- **Testing Utilities**: Comprehensive testing support

## Who Should Use Recursica?

### Design Teams
