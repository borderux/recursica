Before editing import/export code, read `apps/recursica-publisher/src/plugin/services/import-export/README.md`.

Limit context to this folder unless the user explicitly asks to expand scope.

When changes alter behavior, stages, or decisions, update the README to keep it accurate.

Record key decisions or lessons learned in the "Lessons Learned" section at the end of the README.

Exceptions should not be caught. If they must be caught, rethrow them. Do not add console logs for caught exceptions.

Follow existing pipeline stage naming and ordering (including Stage 9.5 and Stage 10.5).
