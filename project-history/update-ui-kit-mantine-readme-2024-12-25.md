# Update UI Kit Mantine README.md - Work Journal
Date: December 25, 2024

## Task Overview
Update the README.md in packages/ui-kit-mantine to accurately reflect what it does, following the AGENT-WORK-INSTRUCTIONS.txt.

## Step 1: Clarify Requirements
The user wants the README.md for ui-kit-mantine to be updated to accurately reflect what the package does. The current README seems comprehensive but may need updates based on:
- Current component list
- Actual features and capabilities
- Correct usage examples
- Updated architecture information

## Step 2: Create Feature Journal
✓ Created this journal in project-history/update-ui-kit-mantine-readme-2024-12-25.md

## Step 3: Analysis
### Current README Analysis:
- The README describes it as "A modern React component library built with TypeScript, Mantine, and Vanilla Extract CSS"
- Lists available components but may not be complete
- Provides installation instructions
- Has comprehensive sections on:
  - Usage and setup
  - Component creation guidelines
  - Styling approaches
  - Design tokens
  - Development commands
  - Best practices
  - Architecture

### Discovered Components (from src/components/index.ts):
- Accordion
- Anchor
- Avatar
- Badge
- Box
- Breadcrumb
- Button
- Checkbox
- Chip
- Datepicker
- Dropdown
- Flex
- Icons (Icon)
- Logo
- Pagination
- Radio
- Tabs
- Textfield
- ThemeProvider
- Tooltip
- Typography

### Potential Issues Found:
1. README lists "Text" and "Title" as separate components but they're not in the exports
2. README lists "Loader" but it's not in the exports
3. Missing components in README: Avatar, Badge, Breadcrumb, Datepicker, Pagination, Radio, Tooltip

## Step 4: Plan
1. Create a new git branch for the work
2. Update the Available Components section to match actual exports
3. Review and update any outdated information
4. Check if usage examples are accurate
5. Verify the architecture section is current
6. Commit changes with clear message
7. Run validation to ensure README is accurate

## Step 5: Implementation
### Started: December 25, 2024

1. ✓ Created git branch: update-ui-kit-mantine-readme
2. Additional findings:
   - Text and Loader components exist in the codebase but are NOT exported in the main index.ts
   - This means they are not available for use, so README should not list them
3. Updating README.md now...

## Step 6: Validation
### Completed: December 25, 2024

1. ✓ Verified all components listed in README match exports in src/components/index.ts
2. ✓ Fixed Button usage example to use correct variant value
3. ✓ Added comprehensive Features section
4. ✓ Updated description to be more specific about Mantine 8+ and Recursica design system
5. ✓ Successfully committed changes to git

- UI Kit Mantine package structure details
