# Unified Release Workflow
#
# This workflow handles releases for ALL packages and apps in the monorepo using Changesets.
# It replaces the previous separate release-plugin.yml and release-plugin-test.yml workflows.
#
# How it works:
# 1. Triggers on changes to .changeset/ files, apps/, packages/, or package files
# 2. Uses Changesets to detect which packages have version changes
# 3. Runs `changeset publish` which:
#    - Bumps version numbers in package.json files
#    - Runs each package's `prepublishOnly` script with appropriate environment variables
#    - Publishes packages to npm in dependency order
# 4. Conditionally creates GitHub releases and deploys only for affected packages
#
# Environment Variables:
# - Production variables (VITE_*) are used by the main figma plugin
# - Test variables (RECURSICA_API_TEST, PLUGIN_PHRASE_TEST) are used by the test plugin
# - Each package's prepublish script handles its own environment variable mapping
#
# Smart Package Detection:
# - GitHub releases are automatically created by Changesets for all packages with changes
# - Only deploys to production when the main figma plugin is released
# - Test plugin releases are handled automatically by Changesets without additional steps

      # Changesets Action - The Core of Our Release System
      #
      # This action has two modes:
      # 1. If changesets are present, it creates a "Version Packages" pull request.
      # 2. When the "Version Packages" PR is merged, it runs the `publish` command.
      #
      # The `publish` command executes `npm run release` which runs `changeset publish --access public`.
      # This command:
      # - Bumps version numbers in package.json files based on changeset files
      # - Runs each package's `prepublishOnly` script in dependency order
      # - Publishes packages to npm with proper authentication
      # - Creates GitHub releases automatically with changelog and links to PRs
      # - Handles all dependency relationships automatically
      #
      # Note: Figma plugins have `publishConfig.access: "restricted"` to prevent npm publishing
      # but still allow Changesets to handle versioning and GitHub releases
