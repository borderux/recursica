# This workflow automates the versioning and release process using Changesets.
#
# How it works:
# 1. When you push `.changeset` files to the `main` branch, this workflow
#    opens a "Version Packages" pull request. This PR contains updated package
#    versions and changelogs.
# 2. When the "Version Packages" PR is merged, the workflow triggers again. This
#    time, it builds the packages, publishes them to npm, and creates a
#    corresponding GitHub Release.
#
# Caching for npm dependencies and Turborepo build artifacts is enabled to
# optimize workflow speed.
