name: Deploy Storybook to GitHub Pages

# This workflow builds and deploys the Storybook from the ui-kit-mantine package
# to GitHub Pages at the /ui-kit-mantine/ subpath.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. GitHub Pages must be enabled in repository settings (Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch)
# 2. Repository must have Pages permissions enabled
# 3. The gh-pages branch must be set as the source branch for GitHub Pages
#
# The Storybook will be available at: https://[username].github.io/recursica/ui-kit-mantine/

on:
  # Trigger on pushes to main branch that affect ui-kit-mantine package
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - "packages/ui-kit-mantine/**"
  # Allow manual triggering from GitHub Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Required permissions for branch-based deployment
permissions:
  contents: write # Read repository contents and write to gh-pages branch

# Prevent multiple main branch deployments from running simultaneously
# This ensures only the latest commit gets deployed to the main Storybook
