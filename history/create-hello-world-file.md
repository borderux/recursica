# History: Create Hello World File (Issue #161)

## Overview
Working on GitHub issue #161: "Create a hello world file in the project"
- **Issue URL**: https://github.com/borderux/recursica/issues/161
- **Requested by**: mlmassey
- **Description**: Create a file called "Hello World" that explains what this project is all about so users can understand better

## Understanding the Project

After examining the codebase, Recursica is a design system tool that:

1. **Core Purpose**: Bridges the gap between design and development by converting Figma design tokens to production-ready code

2. **Main Components**:
   - **Figma Plugin**: Exports design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.) from Figma to JSON format
   - **Mantine Adapter**: Converts JSON tokens into:
     - Mantine theme configuration (React UI framework themes)
     - TypeScript type definitions for type safety
     - Vanilla Extract CSS-in-JS themes
     - React icon components
   - **UI Kit**: Mantine-based React components that use the generated themes
   - **Web/Docs Apps**: Next.js applications (part of the monorepo)

3. **Workflow**:
   - Designers create and maintain design tokens in Figma
   - Use Recursica Figma plugin to export tokens to JSON
   - Run the Mantine adapter to generate theme files and types
   - Developers use the generated themes and components in their applications

## Plan

1. Clarify requirements by understanding what format and location the "Hello World" file should have
2. Update the GitHub issue with clarifications
3. Create the Hello World file that explains the project
4. Create a pull request referencing issue #161

## Current Status
- [x] Examined project structure and documentation
- [x] Understood the project's purpose and components
- [x] Clarify requirements for the Hello World file
- [x] Reviewed GitHub issue #161
- [x] Created HELLO_WORLD.md file
- [x] Created feature branch and pushed to GitHub
- [x] Prepared PR description

## Clarification Approach

Since I can't directly comment on the GitHub issue, I'll proceed with creating the Hello World file based on these specifications:
- **Name**: `HELLO_WORLD.md` (markdown format)
- **Location**: Root directory
- **Content**: Beginner-friendly introduction covering what Recursica is, why it exists, simple workflow example, and quick start guide

The clarifications will be included in the PR description when created.

## Implementation Details

Created `HELLO_WORLD.md` with the following sections:
- Introduction explaining what Recursica is
- Problem statement showing real-world frustrations
- Plain English explanation with house-building analogy
- Real-world example showing the complete workflow
- Quick start guides for both designers and developers
- Benefits breakdown for different stakeholders
- Common use cases
- Architecture overview
- Links to detailed documentation
- Etymology of the name "Recursica"

The file is comprehensive (6KB), beginner-friendly, and uses emojis and examples to make it engaging and easy to understand.
