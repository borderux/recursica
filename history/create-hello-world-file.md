# Create Hello World File Journal

## Date: 2024-01-10

## Requirement
Create a new file in the root of the repository with the contents "Hello World".
- Filename: HELLOW_WORLD.md
- Location: Repository root
- Content: "Hello World"

## Analysis
- This is a simple file creation task
- The file should be created in the root directory of the repository
- The filename is HELLOW_WORLD.md (note: user specified "HELLOW" not "HELLO")
- Content is just "Hello World"
- Project structure: This is a Turborepo monorepo with multiple packages and apps
- Root directory contains various configuration files and documentation
- KEY_FINDINGS.md does not exist yet (will create if needed)
- No existing file with the name HELLOW_WORLD.md in the root

## Plan
1. Create a new git branch for this work
2. Create the file HELLOW_WORLD.md in the repository root
3. Add the content "Hello World" to the file
4. Commit the changes with appropriate message
5. Validate the file exists and has correct content
6. Update KEY_FINDINGS.md if needed
7. Push changes and create PR
