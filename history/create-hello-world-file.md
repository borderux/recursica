## Analysis
*Starting analysis...*

### Project Understanding
- This is a Turborepo monorepo project
- Contains multiple packages and apps (docs, web, ui components, configs)
- Uses TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier
- Has a history folder for documenting changes
- KEY_FINDINGS.md doesn't exist yet (should be created)
- Previous work follows a structured approach with git branches and commits

### Task Analysis
- Simple file creation task
- File should be created in the root directory (same level as README.md)
- Content is straightforward: "Hello World" without newline
- No dependencies on other files or packages

## Plan

**Step 4: Create plan**

1. Create a new git branch for this work
2. Create the HELLO_WORLD.md file in the root directory with content "Hello World"
3. Verify the file was created correctly:
   - Check file exists in root
   - Check content is exactly "Hello World" with no newline
   - Check file is readable
4. Create/update KEY_FINDINGS.md with relevant information
5. Commit changes with clear message
6. Push changes and create pull request

**Dependencies:** None - this is a standalone task
