 * Prepublish Script for Main Figma Plugin
 *
 * This script runs automatically when the main figma plugin is published via Changesets.
 * It ensures the plugin is built with production environment variables after the version
 * number has been bumped by Changesets.
 *
 * Uses the existing 'build' script which builds for production.
 *
 * Environment Variables:
 * - VITE_RECURSICA_API_URL: Production API URL
 * - VITE_RECURSICA_UI_URL: Production UI URL
 * - VITE_PLUGIN_PHRASE: Production plugin phrase
 *
 * The main figma plugin always builds for production - test environment variables
 * are handled by the separate test plugin's prepublish script.
