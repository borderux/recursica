# TODO List

1. Instance table in our fimga.json has strange values for cProps
2. libraries key in our exported json has a libNm and a key. Not sure we should have that. We don't care about libraries
3. We have \_unhandledKeys with \_unknownType. Should we even include unhandled keys, since its not useful. Also, \_unknownType is useless
4.
